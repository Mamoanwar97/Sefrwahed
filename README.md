# Sefrwahed

This is Sefrwahed last updated website (www.sefrwahedegypt.com).
I contributed in the main page in updating 3 Sections: Who are we, events, and contact us section, added the pop-up (It will be added to the website soon working just working on adding a feature to the popup before puplishing it). I also worked from scratch on the Code Geist page (www.sefrwahedegypt.com/code-geist) .

## Events-section:
Meged its design from code geist page. i also generated the cards with javascript and added to them dynamic date for the count down.

## Code Geist page:
With the help of Sefrwahed design team and considering our theme for Code Geist, I designed the page and and fully equiped it and it will be updated with new features and fixes.
